# To Do: An Example Web App

This is an example app for demonstrating one approach to front end web
application architecture. It is a work in progress and is not intended to be a
full-fledged application for serious use.

It is also not intended to be an authoritative, single solution to rule them
all. I make no claim that this is the best way to do things. It is just one way
that I have found to work well for me. And even that might not always be the
case.
